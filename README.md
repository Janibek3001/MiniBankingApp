# Mini Banking App

## Plan

- So the plan is writing a console based Mini Banking App.
- To write it, I thought about the actually a bank App.
- In bank App, there are banch of operation will be, but in my app, it is the mini version of the app,
- where it is likely to be a miniversion of the app


## Actual how my app works?


- So in my app there will be the three classes, main clases such as: Account, User, Transaction and Bank
- Actually it will be 4 classes...

## User

- In the User section, user can only register or login and exit the account.
- What User class cannot do?
- That is the main question actually.
- When you register the account, you just enter your age, name, and phone number.
- You cannot add the balance of the card! The account will be registered by the phone number and password.
- You cannot make the transitions and change the balance

## Account

- It will show the balance of the User, When he creates the account, it must show the for which user it has been created the account and what is the balance in this account.
- Giving the task to Transition class and make the change in the balance. 
- Show the how much money in this account, and showing the history of Transactions, in one account let say there have been 12 transactions and all transactions will be held in the List in one object.
- Cannot directly make the payment

## Transaction

- So in the transaction, there will be any payment methods. Like transfer for some summ into other card, or into number and so on.
- Transaction cannot view how much money user has, and cannot make change into this summ.

## Exception

- There will be exception like a about the money in minus
- Card number wrong
- phone number wrong
